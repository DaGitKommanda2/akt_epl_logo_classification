# Deep Learning & Computer Vision Project - EPL Logo Classification
## Project Structure
The [Notebook](Notebook.ipynb) contains the source code and observed training and test results of multiple trained convolutional neural networks that classify team logos of English Premier League Soccer teams. All necessary dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/english-premier-league-logo-detection-20k-images). Make sure that the whole dataset is contained in a folder named `epl-logos` with subfolders for each class containing all the images of that class and that the `epl-logos` folder is in the same folder as the [Notebook](Notebook.ipynb).
